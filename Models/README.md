## Model Higgs 2.0
It contains the model of the system made in MATLAB System Composer.

The system design has been done in two steps. The first one is a descriptive block structure of the
hardware and functional architectures, including stereotypes, properties, and links to requirements of
the different system composer blocks.

This pdf deliverable contains all the system design and models for simulation done in
MATLAB System Composer and Simulink.

There are 2 main folders:

	-"Descriptive": IT IS NOT FOR SIMULATION. It Contains the descriptive block 
	structure of the hardware and functional architectures, including stereotypes,
	properties, and links to requirements of the different system composer blocks.
	These were described in the "System Design" previous deliverable, which only
	allowed to upload a pdf. 
	

	-"Simulation": CONTAINS THE FILES NEEDED FOR SIMULATION. It is the simplified 
	practical model for simulation. Its use, structure, and instructions for simulation
	are described in the document of this deliverable (System Model).
