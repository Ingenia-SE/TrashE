# TrashE
The TrashE project aims to upgrade the obsolete Higgs 1.0, the UGV used a long time ago by the ASLab team of the UPM for autonomous systems research, to the brand new Higgs 2.0, with cutting-edge devices and renewed structure.

This GitHub repository contains all the work done by the TrashE team during the Ingenia System Engineering 2021/22.
Here you can find both the programmes produced and the user manuals and reports.

The structure of the repository is as follows:

# Models: 
It contains the model of the system made in MATLAB System Composer.

# ign_tutorials:
Code developed when making the official Ignition Gazebo tutorials together with some notes taken with various problems and their solutions.

# p3at_sim:
Code of the Ignition Gazebo simulation of the Pioneer 3 AT, a robot with the same structure as the Higgs 2.0.

# Documentation:
It contains useful documents for the project such as the Project Report, the System Requirements, the System Engineering Management Plan, etc.

In addition, each section includes its own README file and corresponding documents together with user manuals.
